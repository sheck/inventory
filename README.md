# Inventory

> Inventory helps your organize and keep track of your stuff.

This app uses
 - Rspec, capybara & factory girl for testing
 - Clearance for authorization
 - Bootstrap for front end framework
 - zbar for barcode scanning directly to Inventory

### Running Locally
1. `bin/setup` (ignore the stuff about dropbox)
2. Rename `config/application.yml.example` to `config/application.yml` and add your own API keys
